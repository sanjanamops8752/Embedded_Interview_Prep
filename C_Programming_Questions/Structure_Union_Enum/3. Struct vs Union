Struct - User defined data type in which each member has its own member space. Size is sum of sizes of all members. 
        All members can hold value at once. 
        Example - GPIO Config 
Union - User defined data type where members have a shared memory space. Size is that of largest number. 
        Only one member can hold value at once. 
        Example - multiple sensors but only one sensor valid at a time.
